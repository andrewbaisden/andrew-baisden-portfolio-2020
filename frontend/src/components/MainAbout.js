						<AboutHeadingH1>My self-summary</AboutHeadingH1>

						<AboutPara>
							Hey my name is Andrew, I am a Full-Stack developer who creates web and mobile applications using
							JavaScript. My Front-End framework of choice is React which I use when working on web apps and React
							Native when I am building mobile apps. I am skilled in various areas and believe that makes me versatile
							as I know quite a few different programming languages. I also have experience with Flutter and Dart so
							that is another option when considering cross platform app development.
						</AboutPara>

						<AboutPara>
							Having a great work life balance is important so remote working is preferential considering our current
							circumstances or at the very least a few days remote working which is flexible. I also have experience as
							a blogger and technical writer which not only aids as a learning tool but it is also a great way to engage
							with the developer community.
