						<AboutHeadingH1>My self-summary</AboutHeadingH1>

						<AboutPara>
							Hey Iâ€™m Andrew a Full Stack Developer from London, England. Programming is one of my passions in life.
							Over the years I have worked with different technical stacks and at the moment I have settled on a fairly
							modern one. React on the Frontend and Node.js on the Backend. I really enjoy the freedom of thinking about
							something creative. And then building it with the tools and knowledge that you know. The majority of my
							most recent skills have been self taught. I find that it is one of the best ways to learn as you can go at
							your own pace.
